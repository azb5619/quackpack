Definition
	A rubber ducky (also known as a bad USB) is a microcontroller
	typically disguised as a standard USB flash drive. The
	microcontroller is recognised as an HID device when plugged in
	to a computer, which instantly allows the ducky to execute a
	series of keystrokes, which can quickly configure the system,
	run scripts, or download malware.

Software
	A rubber ducky can be programmed in a variety of ways. Some
	choose to use the Ducky Script, which is a very simple
	scripting language that can be learned in minutes. Others
	choose to program their ducky in programming languages such
	as Python, Javascript, or even C.

Uses
	Rubber duckies are used in the world of pentesting typically
	in order to test the human actors in a company. If a
	pentester is able to insert a rubber ducky into a company
	computer, or if an employee inserts a gifted or planted USB
	into a computer then that demonstrates a vulnerability in the
	company's security.
