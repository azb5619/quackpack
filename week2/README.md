# Week 2: Script to the good part!

## Deliverable
Set up your Ubuntu (or other Linux distro of choice) VM and write a simple script proving you were on the system. For example, output a file, change the shell, even a rickroll would work! When you finish, post it to GitHub. Let me know if you have any questions. :)
